Feature: Update Users  

  In order to update an account
  As a valid Converter customer

  Background: Sets authentication
    Given I set valid authentication headers

  @skipTest @createUser @deleteUser
  Scenario: Verify that is possible to update the user information
    When I send a PUT request to "/user/edit/{id}" with following form data
      | username | laura1    |
      | name     | laura     |
      | lastName | montano   |
      | password | Secret123 |
    Then I validate the response has the "200" status code
    And I validate that the response body should match with "common/messageResponse.json" JSON schema
    And I validate that the response contain the following values
      | status  | 200         |
      | message | User edited |

  @skipTest @createUser @deleteUser
  Scenario:  Verify that is not possible to update the user information using an invalid id
    When I send a PUT request to "/user/edit/-1" with following form data
      | username | laura1    |
      | name     | laura     |
      | lastName | montano   |
      | password | Secret123 |
    Then I validate the response has the "400" status code
    And I validate that the response body should match with "common/errorResponse.json" JSON schema
    And I validate that the response contain the following values
      | status | 400                                  |
      | error  | The user with Id: {id}does not exist |
